# Restaurant-Management-System

I successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive restaurant management system to streamline key operations, including order tracking, menu management, and customer reservations, utilizing PHP and CSS. This system significantly improved operational efficiency by automating manual tasks, reducing errors, and enhancing the overall user experience through an intuitive and responsive interface. By leveraging my expertise in PHP for server-side logic and database integration, alongside CSS for creating a visually appealing front-end, I delivered a functional, user-friendly solution. This project reflects my ability to combine technical skills and design principles to address real-world challenges effectively and efficiently.
